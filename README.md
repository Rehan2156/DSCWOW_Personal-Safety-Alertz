# Problem Statement
Women Safety is a large subject with multiple facets and challenges. We have focused on a subsection of this as a problem to solve.

Considering the low trust and safety levels in the cities, women when alone (while on travel or stay) need to ensure safety in case something doesn’t feel right.

Their needs for feeling safe could be categorized as:
1) Knowing that their loved ones are aware of their location in case their mobile battery is about to die.
2) There is help at hand in case of an emergency 
3) On demand need for assistance

# Solution

<b>Instant message to close friends:</b> Whenever the user’s battery falls below a certain limit(x%) our app automatically sends an SMS alert message to the trusted contacts saying that your phone battery is x% and is about to die, along with maps link of your current location. 

It is also possible to manually send an alert on just a single tap of the button, a pre-saved personalized text message along with the users current location will be sent directly as an SMS to the users trusted contacts.

<b>Emergency buttons:</b> In the need of emergency, the user can now easily call the police, ambulance or fire brigade, by clicking on respective emergency buttons without any hassle of dialing the numbers.
